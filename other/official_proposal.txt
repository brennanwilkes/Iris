********************

Every class the three of us will decide upon different tasks for the day. For example, 
Michael might work on a camera control script, while Romar  works on a new sword model, 
while Brennan works on a stairs detection and climbing script.

This will mean that all three of us will be working on different scripts for the project,
but no one will have to wait for someone else to finish work before they can do their own.
